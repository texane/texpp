. add a way to find near comment blocks. For instance:
.. extract comments in top of interface
.. extract comments at beginning of the file
. language agnostic tag based extraction. only assume in comments.
. non language agnostic extraction: as currently done, but need rework
. separate language parser and backends, ie. refer to staticmethods
. exclude section{}
